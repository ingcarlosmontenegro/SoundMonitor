  abstract    = {We present the Sounds of New York City (SONYC) project, a smart cities initiative focused on developing a cyber-physical system for the monitoring, analysis and mitigation of urban noise pollution. Noise pollution is one of the topmost quality of life issues for urban residents in the U.S. with proven effects on health, education, the economy, and the environment. Yet, most cities lack the resources to continuously monitor noise and understand the contribution of individual sources, the tools to analyze patterns of noise pollution at city-scale, and the means to empower city agencies to take effective, data-driven action for noise mitigation. The SONYC project advances novel technological and socio-technical solutions that help address these needs. SONYC includes a distributed network of both sensors and people for large-scale noise monitoring. The sensors use low-cost, low-power technology, and cutting-edge machine listening techniques, to produce calibrated acoustic measurements and recognize individual sound sources in real time. Citizen science methods are used to help urban residents connect to city agencies and each other, understand their noise footprint, and facilitate reporting and self-regulation. Crucially, SONYC utilizes big data solutions to analyze, retrieve and visualize information from sensors and citizens, creating a comprehensive acoustic model of the city that can be used to identify significant patterns of noise pollution. These data can be used to drive the strategic application of noise code enforcement by city agencies to optimize the reduction of noise pollution. The entire system, integrating cyber, physical and social infrastructure, forms a closed loop of continuous sensing, analysis and actuation on the environment. SONYC provides a blueprint for the mitigation of noise pollution that can potentially be applied to other cities in the US and abroad.},

It is caused by a varied number of sources and is widely present not only in the busiest urban environments, it is also pervading once natural environments. The adverse effects can be found in the well-being of exposed human populations, in the health and distribution of wildlife on the land and in the sea, in the abilities of our children to learn properly at school and in the high economic price society must pay because of noise pollution. The European soundscape is under threat and this report sets out to quantify the scale of the problem, assess what actions are being taken and to scope those that may need to be considered in the future, in order to redress the problem.},

  abstract  = {Background: Road traffic noise is a major public health issue, given the documented association with several diseases and the growing number of exposed persons all over the world. The effects widely investigated pertain to cardiovascular health, and to a lesser extent to respiratory and metabolic health. The epidemiological design of most studies has made it possible to ascertain long-term associations of urban noise with a number of cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic disorders and diseases; additionally, time series studies have reported short-term associations. Objectives: To review the various biological mechanisms that may account for all long-term as well as short-term associations between road traffic noise and cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic health. We also aimed to review the neuroendocrine processes triggered by noise as a stressor and the role of the central nervous system in noise-induced autonomic responses. Methods: Review of the literature on road traffic noise, environmental noise in general, psychosomatics, and diseases of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic systems. The search was done using PubMed databases. Discussion: We present a comprehensive, integrative stress model with all known connections between the body systems, states, and processes at both the physiological and psychological levels, which allows to establish a variety of biological pathways linking environmental noise exposure with health outcomes. Conclusions: The long- and short-term associations between road traffic noise and health outcomes found in latest noise research may be understood in the light of the integrative model proposed here.},

The main aim of the paper is to design and develop a novel fraud detection method for Streaming Transaction Data, with an objective, to analyse the past transaction details of the customers and extract the behavioural patterns. Where cardholders are clustered into different groups based on their transaction amount. Then using sliding window strategy [1], to aggregate the transaction made by the cardholders from different groups so that the behavioural pattern of the groups can be extracted respectively. Later different classifiers [3],[5],[6],[8] are trained over the groups separately. And then the classifier with better rating score can be chosen to be one of the best methods to predict frauds. Thus, followed by a feedback mechanism to solve the problem of concept drift [1]. In this paper, we worked with European credit card fraud dataset.},
